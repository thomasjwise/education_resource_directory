## Session Summary: 

Although correctly displaying information is important, preparing plots for publication or distribution can arguably considered equally important. During this hands-on practical workshop, we will dive into the more technical aspects of preparing data visualisations for publication including: 

* Specifying visual space: themes, their defaults and how to adapt them.
* Specifying axis's: scales, breaks and designs
* Specifying Labels, Titles, annotations and additional points.
* Specifying Layouts: ggarrange vs faceting

---

## Session Objectives:
* Understand how to apply good data visualisation practices to publish plots
* Understand the flexibility of ggplot, and how to utilize this flexibility in producing 		publishable plots 


## Transferable Skills: 
* Using the tidyverse, in particular ggplot
* Advanced functions in ggplot, relating to specific graphical customization
* Creating standardized plots for publication
