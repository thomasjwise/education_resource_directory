## Session Summary: 

Coding is an ever-increasing skill used within data analysis, whether through Excel, Python or R. However, for many this may be a source of anxiety, with the thought that coding is only procedural with no room for creativity and expression. 


During this 90-minute interactive session, we will work through how to create artwork and artistic designs using packages part of the Tidyverse. Although focused on the bare bones of artistic design, we will aim to explore more advanced techniques alongside the fundamentals of producing artistic patterns. So, whether a Master of R, or simply an interested beginner, all are welcome to come on this aRtistic-adventure. For examples of work please see:
