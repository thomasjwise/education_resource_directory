## Introduction 

First created in August 2020, for the [Office for National Statistics](<https://www.ons.gov.uk/>), for use in their protected learning within the Economic Statistics Group (ESG). The aim of this workshop and teaching resources is to provide a creative, procedural and non-code or mathematically heavy introduction to data visualisation within R, through the production of artistic designs. This is design to provide a positive introduction to data visualisation without extensive previous knowledge of mathematics (beyond high school), programming (in R) or data visualisation. Whilst providing plently or structured room for exploration and experimentation. 

As of November 2020, this workshop was reduced to 90 minutes, to which the slides have been provided. However the practical is aimed to be self-guided and can take as long as is required. 

## Session Objectives

* To be introducted to the R Universe, in particular the [tidyverse](<https://www.tidyverse.org/>) and [ggplot2](<https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/>). 
* To be able to code something *artistic* in R. 
* To begin to think more creatively regarding code, and data analysis. 
* To consider the beauty of code, mathematics and patterns. 

## Transferable Skills 

* Basic introduction to the use of R and the [tidyverse](<https://www.tidyverse.org/>).
* Basic visualisation techniques using [ggplot2](<https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/>).
* Creative Problem solving and debugging.
