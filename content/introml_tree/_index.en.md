## Session Summary: 

Tree-based machine learning models, have provided the foundation for some of the most advanced, accessible and accurate machine learning techniques used in data science. During this session we will explore a theoretical and practical overview of decision trees as one example of tree-based methods and introduce how to interpret and evaluate these models. 

Please note: Due to time constraints, this session will not cover Decision Tree Pruning, rather this will be covered in the next session Introduction to Machine Learning - Tree-based Models 2.
