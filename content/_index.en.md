# Educational Resources

These are educational resources which have been made to improve professional education surrounding key topics in R. All of these resources are free and open source, created by [Thomas J Wise](<thomasjwise.com>), and currently provided to the Office for National Statistics and Amsterdam UMC. These resources come as both independently guided practicals (available online), as worksheets (available to download via github) or as taught workshops. If your business or organization are interested in having one of these (or another session) provided to your employees, through a workshop session please contact [Thomas directly](<thomas.j.wise@outlook.com>).

If you like these educational resources, and would like to make a suggestion for future content, or help to provide support so I can continue creating this content, please consider helping fund me through [buying me a coffee](<https://www.buymeacoffee.com/thomasjwise>).
